# Yu-Gi-Oh! Bot

A bot designed to generate new Yu-Gi-Oh! cards based on existing ones.

## Features

* Natural Language processing to understand how card titles are structured, and use those existing formats to create
new titles. May also be used to generate new card text using the 
[Puzzle-Solving Card Text](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Problem-Solving_Card_Text) method.
* Image processing to create new card images and integrate them into card templates.
* Integration with Social Media APIs ([Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/), 
[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/post-and-engage/overview)) if copyright claims can be avoided.
